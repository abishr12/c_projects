# Project Context

This project follows Robert Nystrom's **Crafting Interpreters** book, which teaches how to build interpreters from scratch.

## Rules

- **NEVER modify any files/folders without explicit permission** from the user
- When explaining code, assume the user has 2-3 years of general programming experience but is learning interpreter/compiler concepts
- Respect the book's structure and examples - this is a learning project
